Hi all. My name is *Simone* and I am a **procrastinator**.

I started this job the day I was born, and since then I persevered to being a procrastinator every day.

Apart from being a procrastinator I have just started a PhD in Artificial Intelligence. I recently graduate in an Ms.C. in AI and after some doubts I decided to continue with the academic career for other 3 years. My goal is to work in R&D in private companies doing great research, mainly product oriented.

## Pascal and lot of free time
