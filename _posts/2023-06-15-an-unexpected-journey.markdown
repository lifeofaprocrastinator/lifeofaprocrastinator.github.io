Hi everybody, I am Simone and I am a M.Sc. student from Italy.
I am currently pursuing a Master Degree in Artificial Intelligence and I am about to graduate in the next month.
I am also working as a Data Scientist (many sins of many faults) in a marketing company located here in Italy.

I will use this space to share my thesis writing journey with you, in the hope that many others could eventually find this helpful and/or encouraging.

For any contact, send me an email using the form @[contact](/blog/contact.html).

Bests, 

Simone.

## The *Big Start* - 15/6/2023

Hey it's me, your friendly neighborhood graduand. Well this is the first day.

As a very chaotic and not-so-well organized person the first day is the worst.

It is like starting the engine of an old car, with smoke and noises coming out from the bonnet. It is mentally hard to start because the route is not clear yet. You just see the giant mountain because you haven't had time to split into hills yet.

Actually I considered myself quite lucky because the research project is already done, which means that now it is just a matter of explaining what I did. Fair enough.

The goal of today is to complete the abstract and write half/all the introduction. 


## One Week Later (+1) - 23/6/2023

Hi everybody, hope you are doing well. 

What to say? Well, as expected, the first days have been harsh. Especially writing the introduction part. The main difficulty lied in finding what to say and how to actually write it.
I indeed rewrite it many many times due the my perfectionism, but it came out to not be perfect as I wanted to be.

I had great days, in which I wrote 4 pages, and "other" days in which I wrote only half of a page.

Luckily, thanks to the suggestion of my supervisor to **"write it and then iterate"** I can say that the situation has been **solved** (almost).

I will provide more updates in the upcoming days, since my actual goal is to finish the draft of the thesis by the end of June. 

Is this possible? We will discover it together!
